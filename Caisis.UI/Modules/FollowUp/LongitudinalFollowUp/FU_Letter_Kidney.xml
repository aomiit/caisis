      Dear
    </greeting>
    <body>
      <p>
        I certainly hope this letter finds you in good health. My records show it has been a while since your last visit to ACME Cancer Center.  Your well being is very important to me and I would like to continue hearing about any new developments regarding your past kidney surgery and your general state of health.
      </p>

        Enclosed in this envelop you will find a survey with questions geared to help me gain a better idea of your current medical status.  If you have some time, please complete this and return it in the enclosed pre-paid envelope.  With the feedback from this survey I hope to gain a better understanding of the long-term effects of kidney surgery, which will help me to improve the quality of my future care.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        In the event that your kidney tumor has recurred, I would like your permission to ask your physician for a copy of your medical records. I assure you that your information will be kept confidential in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
