      Dear 
    </greeting>
    <body>
      <p>
        I certainly hope that this letter finds you well.  It has been awhile since your surgery for bladder cancer, and I am interested in hearing about your state of health since our last contact. If you could complete the following questionnaire and return it to us in the enclosed, postage-paid envelope, I would be very grateful.
      </p>

        In the event that your cancer has recurred, I would like your permission to ask your current physician for a copy of your medical records. I assure you that your information will be kept confidential in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
        Thank you very much for your kind cooperation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that your participation will benefit you and others in the future by helping us to continuously improve the quality of treatment for bladder cancer.  I look forward to hearing from you.
        If you have any questions, please feel free to jot them down at the bottom of the letter.  You may also telephone my office at <PHYS_PHONE></PHYS_PHONE>.
