	**************************************************************************************************
	
	DATASETS ALLOW YOU TO SEGREGATE SETS OF PATIENTS BY ANY OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
   
  Institution
	Physician
	Protocol
	Disease
	All
   
  Using INSTITUTION IS MOST COMMON (can also be used to separate patients by service/dept). 
  	
	The "All" Dataset has access to all patients in the database. Should be used by System Administrators 
	if you have multiple datasets. 
   
  Please note, at minimum you MUST have at least one dataset defined in the XML below. The dataset id
	defined there MUST match the dataset id in the database DataSets table.
	
	SQL used to create patient datasets is based on the XML below. <dim Group=""> creates AND/OR 
	relationship in SQL string.

	The physician dimension can take two values: physician last name and physician first name.
  <dimension type="Physician" value="Jones" value2="Tom"/>
	All other dimensions take one value only. 
  <dimension type="Institution" value="MSK"/>
	
	A workflow to facilitate the administration of this system is being built, in the meantime see the
  documentation on the caisis.org/WIKI or email CaisisAdmin@mskcc.org with questions.
